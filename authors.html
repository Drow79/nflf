                        <p>Announcing the North Florida Literacy Festival's first keynote speaker: Kelly Milner Halls
                            Please help us give her a warm welcome to Tallahassee in August!</p>
                        <p>
                            Award winning children's nonfiction author Kelly Milner Halls is best known for her quirky choice of topics and extensive, journalistic research. Encouraging critical thinking skills through topics like Bigfoot, UFOs, ghostly entities, dinosaurs and mummies makes her a popular speaker at schools and festivals all over the country. "If we entertain the wonders of young readers, join them in their enthusiasm for discovery on the topics that pique them most, we have endless opportunities to learn and teach by their sides."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            TALES OF THE CRYPTIDS, an exploration of mysterious animals that may or may not be real -- animals like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster -- is perhaps her best known book title, with more than 40,000 copies sold in the past decade. ALIEN INVESTIGATION examines evidence for and against UFOs and aliens from other worlds. GHOSTLY EVIDENCE represents four years of paranormal research. And her newest title, DEATH EATERS maps out the science of decomposition in the natural world. While most of her 45 books are works of nonfiction, she has two novels inspired by true events on her resume -- BLAZING COURAGE, a novel about a girl who rescues horses, and DIVE INTO DANGER about a boy's brush with a humpback whale.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Future books will tackle topics including the microscopic tardigrade, chimpanzee rescue facilities and magical true stories written in geologic stone. She has written for children for 25 years, but other titles will soon follow. "As long as young readers are curious," Halls says, "I'll do my best to feed their curiosities with the best information I can find."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Halls makes her home in Spokane, Washington with two daughters, too many cats, a great dane and a four foot rock iguana named Gigantor.

                            <p>
                            Some years ago, it occurred to me that I had something to say about a subject near and dear to me: sensuality, sexuality, and ME! I laughed at myself when I realized I wanted to share my thoughts with others. Important people in my life encouraged me so I decided to put my thoughts on paper and to see how others might respond. It began as a lark, at least that’s what I told myself, it developed into a genuine interest, and became a desire to push my imagination.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            I have enjoyed reading many of the erotic classics, as well as more recently published works. The notion of writing what I came to know was called erotica appealed to me.One of the most     important discoveries I made was how wonderful it felt to give myself permission to imagine the moments…the touches, tastes and sounds; the wonderfully juicy feelings involved in sharing with a partner or with oneself.
